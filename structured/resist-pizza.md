This problem was designed to help teams select food for the IEEE Xtreme that would provide a more balanced diet and therefore improve their performance in the competition.

Task
Write a program that takes as an input a number of different pizza combinations and estimates the total calories eaten for that meal.

The input should be of the form: number of different pizza combinations, number of slices of each pizza, and toppings selected for each of the slices.

## Input
The input will contain:

1 <= different pizza combinations <= 100
For each pizza combination: 
0 <= Number of slices of pizza eaten < 100
A comma separated list of toppings with at least one topping (no spaces before/after commas).
Output
The output should state, “The total calorie intake is “ followed by the number of calories. 
Note: There is a newline character at the end of the last line of the output string.

Sample Input 1
2 1 Pepperoni 2 Pineapple,Ham

Sample Output 1
The total calorie intake is 1024
